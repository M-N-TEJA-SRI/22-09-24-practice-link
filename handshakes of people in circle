n people are sitting in a circular manner and each person shaked hand with the adjacent people already now the condition is that every person should shake hand with remaining all other people
so tell the count of the shakehands left?
already each person shaked hand with two adjacent people =>n-2 
no one would shake hand with one's own self so total n-3
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    // Write C++ code here
   int n;
   cin>>n;
   if(n<3)
   cout<<0;
   else
   cout<<(n*(n-3))/2;
    return 0;
}
output
5
5

dry run
12345 are the people
(1,2)(1,3)(1,4)(1,5)(2,3)(2,4)(2,5)(3,4)(3,5)(4,5)
  total =10
  the adjacent shakehands which are done
(1,2)(1,5)(5,4)(4,3)(2,3)
  leftover shakehands=5
